Created a Streamlit-based poll app that allows users to vote, view their current results, and reset the votes. 
The app saves the votes to a file for persistent storage and loads them upon reset. 
The app has a user-friendly interface with options to navigate between the voting and result pages, reset the polls, and visualize the results using a bar chart.
